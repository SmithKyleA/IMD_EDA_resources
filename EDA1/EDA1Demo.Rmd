## Pre-EDA
### Interviewing the ecology
This informs what visualizations and summaries might show informative patterns later in the EDA process.  It also helps identify the audience or audiences for the EDA and more formal analyses.

1. What resources/types of ecological data are represented in the dataset?

Vegetation data on shrubland plant communities; the shrubland community of interest is dependent on the park. JOTR =  Joshua trees; LAKE, MOJA = creosote; GRBA, PARA = sagebrush; MANZ = rabbitbrush (DEVA not included yet, will monitor blackbrush?). Data include several SOPs, all data collected reflects that of BLM's AIM protocol. Primary SOPs include LPI, basal gaps, canopy gaps, soil surface information, tree cover, and invasive species.

1. What does the protocol or study plan say is purpose of the data collection?

The purpose of the data is to understand status and trends in upland vegetation.

1. What is the geographical span of the dataset? Are there major divisions within that span (e.g., park units, lakes, watersheds, habitats)? 

1. What is the temporal span of the dataset? Is there fundamental seasonality in that span (e.g., sites visited once a month, every summer, etc.)? Is there any rotating panel design in the observation schedule? 

1. What potential stressors might affect spatial or temporal variation?  What patterns of variation (spatial or temporal) would be expected?  Changes in means, durations, extremes, spatial or temporal variance, flashiness, etc.

These data are collected in 4 different shrubland communities across six parks. The sample schedule has varied over the years. One one park has been visited twice, LAKE. The first sampling year was early winter, second visit was in spring (peak phenology for creosote). PARA and GRBA monitoring occured in summer (peak phenology for sagebrush).

1. What are the potential ecological consequences of these variables?  What form? Degree days, highest temperature sustained for 5+ days, extremes, etc.  Not just mean or median. Were there environmental changes during the span of data collection that could influence results (changes in land use, wildfire, drought, etc.)

1. Are there additional datasets that could provide covariates for later stages of EDA?

### Management considerations
1. Are there defined thresholds to trigger management tied to the dataset?
JOTR and PARA are concerned with pinyon encroachment, though no threshold has been established (these parks are not fully implemented).

### Interview with a Dataset: Descriptive Metadata

1. Based on data certification/QC, is this a reliable dataset? Garbage in -> garbage out. Consider precision/accuracy, consistency over time, etc.
1. What is the resource represented in the dataset?
1. What are the primary goals of the data collection?

### Interview with a Dataset: Structural, Supporting, and Response Variables

1. What constitutes an “observation” for this dataset? By this definition, how many observations are in the dataset?
1. What are the structural variables represented in the dataset (i.e., information about how/where/when data were collected)? Unlike supporting variables, such as comments, without structural variable data the records cannot be parsed. What types of data are these structural variables (e.g., factors, boolean,continuous integers, etc.) and what is their expected range?
1. What are the response variables recorded in the dataset?
1. What are the supporting variables recorded in the dataset (e.g., comments, notes, accuracy assessments)?

### Data Summary & Visualization
EDA0 begins with summary statistics. Most of this can be done in just a few lines of code with automated EDA packages in R.

1. Graph the patterns in the structural variables (e.g., dates, sites): are observations evenly spaced within/between the structural variables and if not, does the pattern line up with the expectations?
1. Categorical response variables: generate a barchart for each variable
1. Numerical response variables: generate descriptive statistics such as boxplots, kernel distributions, 5-number summaries and/or histograms for each variable
1. How many missing values are there? Does this bring up questions or concerns about the dataset?
1. What patterns do you notice?

## EDA1

### Data Summary & Visualization
EDA1 continues to look at summary statistics, this time broken down by structural variables. This step may illuminate patterns that were not apparent in EDA0 (e.g. patterns in missing values by site or over time).

1. Repeat description of variables, this time focusing on groups (such as site, year, species):
    1. Categorical response variables: generate a barchart for each variable
    1. Numerical response variables: generate descriptive statistics such as boxplots, kernel distributions, 5-number summaries and/or histograms for each variable
1. Do you notice any patterns in outliers and anomalies?
1. At this point, consider the natural history and ecology of your system. How does that relate to trends or relationships that appear from initial exploration of the dataset?
