## About this Repository
This repository was created by the Exploratory Data Analysis Workgroup in the Inventory & Monitoring division. In March-June of 2020, participants in the EDA Workgroup shared early renditions of exploratory data analysis projects they were working on. Throughout the fall of 2020, people at different networks are invited to share EDA projects they're working on. While the code and the products are helpful, the thought process, rationale, and decisions will be the focus of this round of EDA calls. 

## IMD_EDA_resources
Use the repository to link to existing exploratory data analysis code created by people at I&M networks. This platform was created for all IMD data managers, -ologists, technicians, and whoever is interested in EDA to ask questions, look at examples from other networks, and share ideas.
